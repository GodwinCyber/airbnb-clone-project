# Team Roles

## Backend Developer
A Backend Engineer is responsible for developing the API logic and handling everything that happens behind the scenes of a software project. Unlike the frontend, which users interact with directly, the backend is where the core logic and data management take place.

Backend engineers:
- Build and maintain the server-side logic.
- Control the flow of data across the entire system.
- Design and manage the architecture of the product.
- Ensure that the application runs efficiently, securely, and at scale.
In short, they master how data moves through the system and make sure everything works seamlessly for the end user.

## DataBase Administrator
They are responsible for managing databases, securing data, and ensuring information is always available when needed. They optimize databases to allow fast and efficient data flow, making systems scalable and reliable.

What They Do
- Database Setup: Install and configure database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or MongoDB.
- Security Management: Implement authentication, encryption, and monitoring to prevent potential breaches.
- Performance Optimization: Improve overall performance by optimizing queries, indexes, and scalability.
- Backup & Recovery: Design and manage backup systems to restore data in case of loss.
- Monitoring: Track database health, usage, and growth, while providing recommendations for improvement.
- Collaboration: Work closely with backend engineers to synchronize data flow across applications.
In short, DBAs play a critical role in keeping data systems efficient, secure, and always accessible.

## DevOps Engineer
A DevOps Engineer is responsible for building and maintaining Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines that automate the development and release process. They bridge the gap between frontend and backend engineers, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient product delivery.

What They Do
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment to speed up delivery.
- Collaboration: Work closely with software developers (frontend and backend) to unify workflows.
- Automation: Ensure that changes are integrated without breaking existing functionality or disrupting data flow.
- Security: Implement secure deployment pipelines to protect applications and infrastructure.
In short, DevOps Engineers make sure software is delivered faster, safer, and more reliably.


## Quality Assurance Engineer
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for testing software products to ensure they meet both functional and non-functional requirements. Their goal is to guarantee product integrity, reliability, and alignment with business expectations.

What They Do
- Testing: Perform manual and automated tests to identify bugs and inconsistencies.
- Requirements Validation: Ensure the product meets specified requirements and user needs.
- Performance Checks: Verify that the system runs efficiently under different conditions.

- Quality Assurance: Ensure the final product is stable, secure, and ready for release.
In short, QA engineers safeguard the quality and trustworthiness of a product before it reaches users.


# Technology Stack

## Django
Django is a database-driven web application framework built with Python. It was designed to make building web applications faster, cleaner, and more secure.

Although you can use Django without a database, it shines because of its built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

__What is an ORM?__
- An ORM lets you interact with your database using Python code instead of raw SQL.
- You write models in Python.
- Django translates them into SQL behind the scenes.
- This makes working with databases easier, more readable, and less error-prone.

__Example: Without ORM (using raw SQL)__
```sql
  -- Creating a "Person" table
  CREATE TABLE persons (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(100),
      last_name VARCHAR(100),
      age INT
  );

  -- Inserting data
  INSERT INTO persons (id, first_name, last_name, age)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 30);

  -- Fetching data
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM persons WHERE id = 1;
```


__Example: With Django ORM__
```python
  # models.py
  from django.db import models

  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      age = models.IntegerField()
```
__Then in Django’s shell:__
```python
  # Insert data
  person = Person(first_name="John", last_name="Doe", age=30)
  person.save()

  # Fetch data
  person = Person.objects.get(id=1)
  print(person.first_name, person.last_name)  # Output: John Doe
```
__Why Django’s ORM is Powerful__
- Readable: You work with Python objects instead of SQL.
- Portable: Switch databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) without changing code.
- Secure: Protects against SQL injection automatically.
- Scalable: ORM takes care of indexing, migrations, and relationships

## Django Rest Framework
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building web APIs.

__Why use Django Rest Framework?__
- Browsable API: Developers can interact with the API directly from the browser, making debugging and testing easier.
- __Authentication Policies:__ DRF supports authentication systems like OAuth1a, OAuth2, JWT, and session-based authentication.
- __Permissions & Throttling:__ Control who can access an endpoint and how often they can access it.
- __Serialization:__ Convert complex data (like Django models or querysets) into JSON, XML, or other formats. Also supports deserialization, which validates incoming JSON and converts it back into Python objects.
- __Customizable:__ Use simple function-based views for lightweight APIs, or powerful class-based views for more complex logic.

__Example 1: A Simple Serializer__
```python
  # serializers.py
  from rest_framework import serializers
  from .models import Person

  class PersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
      class Meta:
          model = Person
          fields = ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age']
```

__Example 2: A Simple API View__
```python
  # views.py
  from rest_framework.views import APIView
  from rest_framework.response import Response
  from .models import Person
  from .serializers import PersonSerializer

  class PersonListView(APIView):
      def get(self, request):
          people = Person.objects.all()
          serializer = PersonSerializer(people, many=True)
          return Response(serializer.data)
```

Now, hitting /api/persons/ will return:
```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 30 },
    { "id": 2, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Smith", "age": 25 }
  ]
```

__Example 3: Using ViewSets + Routers (More DRF Power)__
```python
  # views.py
  from rest_framework import viewsets
  from .models import Person
  from .serializers import PersonSerializer

  class PersonViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
      queryset = Person.objects.all()
      serializer_class = PersonSerializer
```
```python
  # urls.py
  from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
  from django.urls import path, include
  from .views import PersonViewSet

  router = DefaultRouter()
  router.register(r'persons', PersonViewSet)

  urlpatterns = [
      path('api/', include(router.urls)),
  ]
```

__Now DRF automatically gives you:__
- GET /api/persons/ → list all people
- POST /api/persons/ → create a new person
- GET /api/persons/{id}/ → retrieve one person
- PUT /api/persons/{id}/ → update a person
- DELETE /api/persons/{id}/ → delete a person

## PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-oriented database management system. It is used in a wide range of applications, from small websites to large enterprise systems. PostgreSQL excels at handling complex data types, detailed queries, and relationships within data. It is well known for its robustness, scalability, and flexibility, making it suitable for diverse use cases.

__PostgrSQL__
PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of the original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and provides many modern features, such as:
- nComplex queries
- Foreign keys
- Triggers
- Views
- Transactional integrity
- Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)

__SQL__
SQL (Structured Query Language) is different from PostgreSQL. SQL is a query language used to interact with relational databases, while PostgreSQL is a database management system (DBMS) that implements SQL (and extends it with advanced features).
In other words, PostgreSQL uses SQL as the language to manage and query data, but it also adds its own powerful capabilities on top.

__Example__
```sql
  -- Creating a "products" table in PostgreSQL
  CREATE TABLE products (
      product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0)
  );

  -- Inserting a row
  INSERT INTO products (name, price)
  VALUES ('Laptop', 1200.50);

  -- Querying data
  SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price > 1000;
```

__Here,__
- SQL is the language you use to define (CREATE TABLE), insert (INSERT), and query (SELECT).
- PostgreSQL is the system that executes these SQL statements, enforces constraints (like CHECK (price > 0)), and manages the data reliably.


## GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries using your existing data. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your APIs. With GraphQL, clients have the power to request exactly what they need and nothing more, making APIs easier to evolve over time and enabling powerful developer tools.

__GraphQL describe your data__
You define a schema that describes the types of data and their relationships. For example:
```graphqlReal-World Use Cases
  type Project {
    name: String
    tagLine: String
    contributors: [User]
  }

  type User {
    id: ID
    username: String
  }
```

__Ask for what you want__
When querying a GraphQL API, you specify the exact fields you want in the response.
```graphql
  {
    project {
      name
      tagLine
      contributors {
        username
      }
    }
  }
```

__Response Example__
```json
  {
    "data": {
      "project": {
        "name": "OpenAI Docs",
        "tagLine": "AI that powers creativity",
        "contributors": [
          { "username": "alice" },
          { "username": "bob" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

__ASk for what you need, get exactly that:__
Send a graph query to your APIs and get exactly what you need nothing more, nothing less.

## Celery
Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system for processing a vast number of messages while providing operations with the tools to maintain such a system. It is primarily a task queue that focuses on real-time processing while also supporting task scheduling.

You can think of Celery as an asynchronous task/job queue that distributes work across multiple workers. It often uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a message broker to send and receive tasks.

__Celery also provides:__
- Result backends to track task results (e.g., Redis, database).
- Monitoring using tools like Flower, a web-based dashboard to inspect and monitor queued tasks.

__How Celery Works__
- The client (your application) sends a task to the broker (e.g., Redis).
- Celery workers listen to the broker, pick up tasks, and execute them.
- The result backend stores the task result for later retrieval.

__Example Setup (Using Redis as Broker)__
- Install Celery and Redis
```bash
  pip install celery redis
```

- Create a Celery Application (tasks.py)
```python
  from celery import Celery

  # Create Celery instance (use Redis as broker & backend)
  app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0', backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')

  @app.task
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
```

- Run Celery Worker
```bash
  celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

- Call the Task from Python Shell
```python
  from tasks import add

  # Send task asynchronously
  result = add.delay(4, 6)

  # Check result
  print(result.get(timeout=10))  # Output: 10
```

- Monitoring with Flower
```bash
  pip install flower
  celery -A tasks flower
```
Flower will provide a dashboard (usually at http://localhost:5555) where you can track tasks, queues, and workers in real time.


## Redis
Redis is an in-memory data store widely used by millions of developers as a cache, vector database, streaming engine, and message broker. It is known for its speed because it stores data in RAM, making read and write operations extremely fast compared to traditional databases.

__Redis supports various complex datatypes with atomic operations defined on them, such as:__
- String
- Hash
- List
- Set
- Sorted Set
- JSON

__Why Redis?__
- Traditional APIs interact directly with a database, which may introduce latency.
- With Redis, frequently accessed data is stored in a cache server (in memory), enabling much faster retrieval.
- Redis also supports data persistence, ensuring data can survive crashes or restarts by writing data periodically to disk.

__Recent Redis advancements include:__
- Redis Database (RDB) for snapshots (data persistence).
- Append Only File (AOF) for logging every operation.
- RedisJSON for JSON document support.
- RedisSearch for full-text search.
- Redis OM (Object Mapping) for working with Redis using OOP patterns.

__Example: Using Redis as a Cache in Python__
- Install Redis and Redis Client
```bash
  # Install redis-py client
  pip install redis
```

- Make sure Redis server is running:
```bash
  redis-server
```

- Python Example (cache_example.py)
```python
  import redis

  # CReal-World Use Casesonnect to Redis (localhost:6379 by default)
  r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

  # Store data (SET key value)
  r.set("username", "godwin")

  # Retrieve data (GET key)
  print(r.get("username").decode("utf-8"))  # Output: godwin

  # Example with expiry (cache)
  r.setex("session_token", 60, "abc123")  # key expires in 60 seconds
  print(r.get("session_token"))  # b'abc123'
```

- Running Commands in Redis CLI
```bash
  bash
  Copy
  Edit
  redis-cli
  > SET product "Laptop"
  OK
  > GET product
  "Laptop"
```

__Real-World Use Cases__
- Caching API responses to reduce load on databases.
- Session storage in web applications (e.g., login sessions).
- Message broker in task queues (e.g., with Celery).
- Leaderboard tracking using Sorted Sets (e.g., gaming apps).
- Pub/Sub for real-time notifications or chat applications.
