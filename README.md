# Team Roles

## Backend Developer
A Backend Engineer is responsible for developing the API logic and handling everything that happens behind the scenes of a software project. Unlike the frontend, which users interact with directly, the backend is where the core logic and data management take place.

Backend engineers:
- Build and maintain the server-side logic.
- Control the flow of data across the entire system.
- Design and manage the architecture of the product.
- Ensure that the application runs efficiently, securely, and at scale.
In short, they master how data moves through the system and make sure everything works seamlessly for the end user.

## DataBase Administrator
They are responsible for managing databases, securing data, and ensuring information is always available when needed. They optimize databases to allow fast and efficient data flow, making systems scalable and reliable.

What They Do
- Database Setup: Install and configure database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or MongoDB.
- Security Management: Implement authentication, encryption, and monitoring to prevent potential breaches.
- Performance Optimization: Improve overall performance by optimizing queries, indexes, and scalability.
- Backup & Recovery: Design and manage backup systems to restore data in case of loss.
- Monitoring: Track database health, usage, and growth, while providing recommendations for improvement.
- Collaboration: Work closely with backend engineers to synchronize data flow across applications.
In short, DBAs play a critical role in keeping data systems efficient, secure, and always accessible.

## DevOps Engineer
A DevOps Engineer is responsible for building and maintaining Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines that automate the development and release process. They bridge the gap between frontend and backend engineers, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient product delivery.

What They Do
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment to speed up delivery.
- Collaboration: Work closely with software developers (frontend and backend) to unify workflows.
- Automation: Ensure that changes are integrated without breaking existing functionality or disrupting data flow.
- Security: Implement secure deployment pipelines to protect applications and infrastructure.
In short, DevOps Engineers make sure software is delivered faster, safer, and more reliably.


## Quality Assurance Engineer
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for testing software products to ensure they meet both functional and non-functional requirements. Their goal is to guarantee product integrity, reliability, and alignment with business expectations.

What They Do
- Testing: Perform manual and automated tests to identify bugs and inconsistencies.
- Requirements Validation: Ensure the product meets specified requirements and user needs.
- Performance Checks: Verify that the system runs efficiently under different conditions.
-  Regression Testing: Confirm that new changes donâ€™t break existing functionality.
- Quality Assurance: Ensure the final product is stable, secure, and ready for release.
In short, QA engineers safeguard the quality and trustworthiness of a product before it reaches users.
