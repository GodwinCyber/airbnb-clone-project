# Team Roles

## Backend Developer
A Backend Engineer is responsible for developing the API logic and handling everything that happens behind the scenes of a software project. Unlike the frontend, which users interact with directly, the backend is where the core logic and data management take place.

Backend engineers:
- Build and maintain the server-side logic.
- Control the flow of data across the entire system.
- Design and manage the architecture of the product.
- Ensure that the application runs efficiently, securely, and at scale.
In short, they master how data moves through the system and make sure everything works seamlessly for the end user.

## DataBase Administrator
They are responsible for managing databases, securing data, and ensuring information is always available when needed. They optimize databases to allow fast and efficient data flow, making systems scalable and reliable.

What They Do
- Database Setup: Install and configure database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or MongoDB.
- Security Management: Implement authentication, encryption, and monitoring to prevent potential breaches.
- Performance Optimization: Improve overall performance by optimizing queries, indexes, and scalability.
- Backup & Recovery: Design and manage backup systems to restore data in case of loss.
- Monitoring: Track database health, usage, and growth, while providing recommendations for improvement.
- Collaboration: Work closely with backend engineers to synchronize data flow across applications.
In short, DBAs play a critical role in keeping data systems efficient, secure, and always accessible.

## DevOps Engineer
A DevOps Engineer is responsible for building and maintaining Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines that automate the development and release process. They bridge the gap between frontend and backend engineers, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient product delivery.

What They Do
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment to speed up delivery.
- Collaboration: Work closely with software developers (frontend and backend) to unify workflows.
- Automation: Ensure that changes are integrated without breaking existing functionality or disrupting data flow.
- Security: Implement secure deployment pipelines to protect applications and infrastructure.
In short, DevOps Engineers make sure software is delivered faster, safer, and more reliably.


## Quality Assurance Engineer
A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer is responsible for testing software products to ensure they meet both functional and non-functional requirements. Their goal is to guarantee product integrity, reliability, and alignment with business expectations.

What They Do
- Testing: Perform manual and automated tests to identify bugs and inconsistencies.
- Requirements Validation: Ensure the product meets specified requirements and user needs.
- Performance Checks: Verify that the system runs efficiently under different conditions.
-  Regression Testing: Confirm that new changes don’t break existing functionality.
- Quality Assurance: Ensure the final product is stable, secure, and ready for release.
In short, QA engineers safeguard the quality and trustworthiness of a product before it reaches users.


# Technology Stack

## Django
Django is a database-driven web application framework built with Python. It was designed to make building web applications faster, cleaner, and more secure.

Although you can use Django without a database, it shines because of its built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

__What is an ORM?__
- An ORM lets you interact with your database using Python code instead of raw SQL.
- You write models in Python.
- Django translates them into SQL behind the scenes.
- This makes working with databases easier, more readable, and less error-prone.

__Example: Without ORM (using raw SQL)__
```sql
  -- Creating a "Person" table
  CREATE TABLE persons (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name VARCHAR(100),
      last_name VARCHAR(100),
      age INT
  );

  -- Inserting data
  INSERT INTO persons (id, first_name, last_name, age)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 30);

  -- Fetching data
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM persons WHERE id = 1;
```


__Example: With Django ORM__
```python
  # models.py
  from django.db import models

  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      age = models.IntegerField()
```
__Then in Django’s shell:__
```python
  # Insert data
  person = Person(first_name="John", last_name="Doe", age=30)
  person.save()

  # Fetch data
  person = Person.objects.get(id=1)
  print(person.first_name, person.last_name)  # Output: John Doe
```
__Why Django’s ORM is Powerful__
- Readable: You work with Python objects instead of SQL.
- Portable: Switch databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) without changing code.
- Secure: Protects against SQL injection automatically.
- Scalable: ORM takes care of indexing, migrations, and relationships

## Django Rest Framework
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building web APIs.

__Why use Django Rest Framework?__
- Browsable API: Developers can interact with the API directly from the browser, making debugging and testing easier.
- __Authentication Policies:__ DRF supports authentication systems like OAuth1a, OAuth2, JWT, and session-based authentication.
- __Permissions & Throttling:__ Control who can access an endpoint and how often they can access it.
- __Serialization:__ Convert complex data (like Django models or querysets) into JSON, XML, or other formats. Also supports deserialization, which validates incoming JSON and converts it back into Python objects.
- __Customizable:__ Use simple function-based views for lightweight APIs, or powerful class-based views for more complex logic.

__Example 1: A Simple Serializer__
```python
  # serializers.py
  from rest_framework import serializers
  from .models import Person

  class PersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
      class Meta:
          model = Person
          fields = ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age']
```

__Example 2: A Simple API View__
```python
  # views.py
  from rest_framework.views import APIView
  from rest_framework.response import Response
  from .models import Person
  from .serializers import PersonSerializer

  class PersonListView(APIView):
      def get(self, request):
          people = Person.objects.all()
          serializer = PersonSerializer(people, many=True)
          return Response(serializer.data)
```

Now, hitting /api/persons/ will return:
```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "age": 30 },
    { "id": 2, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Smith", "age": 25 }
  ]
```

__Example 3: Using ViewSets + Routers (More DRF Power)__
```python
  # views.py
  from rest_framework import viewsets
  from .models import Person
  from .serializers import PersonSerializer

  class PersonViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
      queryset = Person.objects.all()
      serializer_class = PersonSerializer
```
```python
  # urls.py
  from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
  from django.urls import path, include
  from .views import PersonViewSet

  router = DefaultRouter()
  router.register(r'persons', PersonViewSet)

  urlpatterns = [
      path('api/', include(router.urls)),
  ]
```

__Now DRF automatically gives you:__
- GET /api/persons/ → list all people
- POST /api/persons/ → create a new person
- GET /api/persons/{id}/ → retrieve one person
- PUT /api/persons/{id}/ → update a person
- DELETE /api/persons/{id}/ → delete a person
